11-12 : Erpnext docs
3 to 5:30 : Erpnext frappe Framework API
7:30 to 8 : Static SIte in Pykyll
8:30 to 9:30 : Copy to clipboard

Leart about the frappe framework and created a simple CRUD API with it. The older installation didn't work, so had to reinitialize the frappe-bench.

Added the copy-to-clipboard feature in the pykyll blog as well on the personal blog. Simply add the button just before the `pre` and `code` tags. Select the code block and fetch the inner text, use clipboard-pollyfill packaage for the clipboard interface.
