Worked on django admin section for fixing and optimizating of the deisgn application. Created a custom field lists and optimized the query results with [raw_id_fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.raw_id_fields) attribute which takes in the foreign key model and just fetches the id instead of all the related instance objects(drop down select option).

- Django Admin Filed list and filters
    - Optimization with `raw_id_fields` for designs, versions, settings and summary.

TIL

Created a field list page with customizable fields of the model.

```pyrhon
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Blog


class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    search_fields = ('id', 'title',)
    list_display = ('title', 'tags',)

admin.site.register(Blog, BlogAdmin)
```

We can speicify the [list_display](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) tuple. Which should be a list of the model fields to be displayed in the admin section(list page). Also for foreign/onetomany relationship fields, we can speicify the `table__attribute` fields. The [search_fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.search_fields) will be used for having a search bar and will look for matching search results in the provided fields. Since, this is a custom class inherited from [ModelAdmin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) we have to speicify the pair with the  actual model and the custom admin class.
